# Harmonia

Welcome to the Harmonia project! This repository contains the source code for the Harmonia microservices application. Harmonia is a demo project that showcases how to build and deploy microservices using ASP.NET Core, RabbitMQ, gRPC, Microsoft SQL Server, Docker, and Kubernetes.

## Overview

Harmonia is a microservices-based application designed to demonstrate the integration of various modern technologies. It includes multiple services that communicate with each other using synchronous and asynchronous messaging.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core**: This is for building the web APIs.

- **Entity Framework Core**: For database interactions.

- **Microsoft SQL Server**: For relational database management.

- **RabbitMQ**: For asynchronous messaging between services.

- **gRPC**: For high-performance, language-agnostic remote procedure calls.

- **Docker**: For containerizing the services.

- **Kubernetes**: For container orchestration and management.
